# Pre-commit Hooks for Rust Learning

## ✅ What's Configured

Your Rust learning project now has pre-commit hooks that automatically:

### 1. **Code Quality Checks**
- ✅ Remove trailing whitespace
- ✅ Fix end-of-file formatting
- ✅ Check YAML and TOML syntax
- ✅ Detect merge conflicts
- ✅ Prevent large file commits

### 2. **Rust-Specific Checks**
- ✅ **rustfmt** - Auto-format your Rust code to standard style
- ✅ **clippy** - Lint your code and suggest improvements
- ✅ **rust-check** - Verify your code compiles before commit

## 🚀 Benefits for Learning

### **Immediate Feedback**
- Catches syntax errors before you commit
- Shows you proper Rust formatting conventions
- Suggests better ways to write code (clippy)

### **Professional Habits**
- Builds good development practices from day one
- Ensures consistent code style across all files
- Prevents "broken" code from entering your git history

### **Learning Accelerator**
- **rustfmt** shows you how Rust code should be formatted
- **clippy** teaches you Rust best practices and idioms
- Helps you write more idiomatic Rust code

## 🔧 How It Works

### **Automatic on Commit**
Every time you run `git commit`, the hooks automatically:
1. Format your code with `rustfmt`
2. Check for common issues with `clippy`
3. Verify compilation with `rust-check`
4. Clean up whitespace and formatting

### **Manual Testing**
You can run hooks manually anytime:
```bash
# Run on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run on specific files
pre-commit run --files basic/hello.rs

# Run specific hook
pre-commit run rustfmt
```

## 📁 Smart File Handling

The configuration is smart about different file types:

### **Basic Examples (`basic/*.rs`)**
- Compiles individual files with `rustc`
- Checks syntax and formatting
- Perfect for learning exercises

### **Cargo Project (`src/*.rs`)**
- Uses `cargo check`, `cargo clippy`
- Handles dependencies and modules
- Proper for larger projects

## 🎯 Example Workflow

1. **Write some Rust code** (even with poor formatting)
2. **Try to commit**: `git add . && git commit -m "learning loops"`
3. **Pre-commit runs automatically**:
   - Fixes formatting issues
   - Shows clippy suggestions
   - Ensures code compiles
4. **Learn from the changes** - see what got fixed!

## 🛠️ Commands to Remember

```bash
# Install hooks (already done)
pre-commit install

# Run all hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files

# Update hook versions
pre-commit autoupdate

# Skip hooks for emergency commits (not recommended)
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency commit"
```

## 🎓 Learning Tips

1. **Before committing**, run `pre-commit run --all-files` to see what would change
2. **Study the diffs** - understand why rustfmt changed your formatting
3. **Read clippy suggestions** - they teach you better Rust patterns
4. **Don't ignore warnings** - they help you learn proper Rust

## 📊 What Just Happened

When we ran the hooks on your existing files, they:
- ✅ Fixed trailing whitespace in multiple files
- ✅ Added missing newlines at end of files
- ✅ Auto-formatted all Rust code with `rustfmt`
- ✅ Found and helped fix a syntax error in `string.rs`
- ✅ Verified all files compile correctly

This is exactly the kind of automatic quality control that will accelerate your Rust learning! 🦀
